	&lt;strong&gt;Welcome&lt;/strong&gt; to Love Coins
	&lt;span class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;WE ARE HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE FOUND US&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;We have got the following situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row featured-box-minimal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Small Business&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt; 
		You have created a small business, but you don&#x27;t many customers.
		Your potential customers don&#x27;t have enough money to pay for your service.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row featured-box-minimal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-users&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Neighborhood&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		In the neighborhood you help each other.
		You can easily remember who you helped and who still owes you a favor.
		But at some point you lose track or someone who owes you a favor or you owes him moves away.
		You have no way to balance the energies.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row featured-box-minimal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-users&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Other Neighborhood Problems&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Let&#x27;s think of a hairdresser who cuts the hair of an auto mechanic.
		Let&#x27;s say she doesn&#x27;t drive a car.
		The car mechanic is therefore not able to balance the energies by repairing their car.
		So he has to pay the hairdressers in cash.
		This in turn makes it necessary for the hairdresser to ask for money.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row featured-box-minimal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-users&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Paying Taxes&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		Do not get me wrong. I have nothing against paying taxes.
		But let me tell you something.
		Every year the government has to take on more debt, because it can&#x27;t even pay the interest.
		And for that we have to pay more and more taxes.
		In Denmark you pay about 51% income tax and an additional 25% VAT.
		The Danes therefore only have 24% of their income.
		Most of your income is used to pay off government debt.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row featured-box-minimal&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-users&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Finacial Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		But there are still bigger problems.
		Do you remember Cyprus 2013?
		There the rich were simply expropriated.
		And the banks were also unable to pay money to their customers.
		&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

                    text: "&lt;h2 class=&quot;margin-top100&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;
	We create money for ourselves by taking a piece of paper and painting a nice picture on it.
	This picture then represents art and already has a value.
	This value can then be used to pay for services and also for goods, if the trading partner accepts them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each artist measures the number of minutes it takes to create this note and writes it on the respective artwork.
	This number of minutes is then immediately the value of the created note. 
	Suppose the artist needs half an hour, then he writes 30 on it.
	Then everyone knows that this note is worth 30 minutes. 
	Then when I give the artist a massage for which I need 90 minutes, I accept three of these notes as payment.
	To be honest, I would of course give this massage to friends for free, but it makes more fun and I 
	can use these notes to express my gratitude to someone else for their service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe you can use land to grow your own food and exchange it for LoveCoins.
	Or you own houses and accept LoveCoins as a rental.
&lt;/p&gt;"

                    text: "&lt;h2 class=&quot;margin-top100&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;
	Help that this type of payment is accepted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every artist is invited to create these LoveCoins.
	When creating these LoveCoins, the artist&#x27;s love flows into this note, which means that it has
	already have a value. Someone created it with love, which unfortunately we don&#x27;t say about the banknotes. 
	Someone has made an effort to create these notes and to make them counterfeit-proof,
	but actually they&#x27;re just copies. The EUR and Dollars are actually worthless. 
	Only we humans give them a value because we accept it as a form of payment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Isn&#x27;t it much better if we accept art as a form of payment?
	If nobody should accept these little pictures anymore, then we can at least hang them on the wall
	and marvel at them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&quot;I believe in this idea.&quot; &lt;/br&gt;
	&quot;I got this idea a few years ago during a New Year&#x27;s workshop in Copenhagen.&quot; &lt;/br&gt;
	&quot;We were invited to send an idea to the world to make it manifest.&quot; &lt;/br&gt;
